🗺️ Mapping Reference & Transformation Library
A comprehensive, version-controlled index of all field mappings and transformation logic from raw source data through GDF (Golden Data Foundation) and into CDF (Client Data Feed). This document ensures transparency, consistency, and auditability.

1. Purpose
Document every field’s journey: raw → GDF → CDF.
Centralize transformation logic and mapping decisions.
Facilitate onboarding, QA, audit, and change management.
2. Mapping Table Template
CDF Field	GDF Field	Raw Field(s)	Transformation Logic	Notes / Business Rule
claim_key	CH_CLAIM_KEY	claim_header.clcl_id	N/A	PK, always populated
client_original_claim_id	CH_CLIENT_CLAIM_ID	client_claim_id	N/A	
capitation_indicator	CH_CAPITATION_IND	capitation_ind	Y→TRUE, N→FALSE	Boolean, required for reporting
claim_paid_amount	CH_CLAIM_PAID_AMOUNT	claim_paid_amount	Multiply by 100, cast to STRING	Stored as cents
...	...	...	...	...
Add more rows and fields as needed. Version-control this table.

3. Common Transformation Patterns
Type	Pattern / Example
Boolean	CASE WHEN src='Y' THEN TRUE WHEN src='N' THEN FALSE ELSE NULL END
Dates	FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(src_dt, 'yyyy-MM-dd'), 'yyyyMMdd')
Amounts	CAST(CAST(src_amt AS DECIMAL(18,2)) * 100 AS BIGINT) AS STRING (for cents storage)
Multi-valued	Map to arrays or indexed fields: DIAG_CODE_01–25
Null Policy	Always use '' (empty string) for blanks, never a space; use NULL only when business-justified
4. Handling Multi-Valued & Array Fields
For diagnoses, procedures, etc., map as:
CH_DIAGNOSIS_CODE_01, CH_DIAGNOSIS_CODE_02, ..., CH_DIAGNOSIS_CODE_25
Document maximum expected cardinality and overflow policy.
5. Field Mapping Documentation Standard
For each mapped field, document:

All raw sources (with table and column)
Transformation logic (SQL or description)
Business rule or validator requirement
Any conditional or override logic
Notes on partial population, suppression, or PHI handling
6. Gaps, Issues, & Customizations
Log all fields with:
No available raw source
Partial or conditional mapping
Custom business logic (explain and cite requirement)
Use a separate "Gap Log" or add an Issues column to the mapping table.
7. Change Management
All mapping changes must be version-controlled and logged with:
Date, field, old mapping, new mapping, reason, and approver.
Reference the Change Management & Issue Log SOP for process details.
