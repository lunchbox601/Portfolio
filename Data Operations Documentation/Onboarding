Obtain credentials for shared drives, Git repositories, and collaboration tools (Slack, Jira, Confluence)
Confirm VPN and remote access as needed

B. Key Tools & Platforms

Hive/HUE: Data exploration, validation, and QC
Airflow: Orchestration of ETL pipelines

Jira: Ticketing and change management
Slack: Team communication (#data-ops-support recommended)

2. Documentation Map
Document/Resource	Purpose	Link
Documentation Home (README)	Main index and navigation	README.md
Validation & QC Guide	Data validation gates and best practices	validation-qc.md
Mapping Reference	Field mappings, transformation logic	mapping-reference.md
Joins Best Practices	Join patterns, deduplication, troubleshooting	joins-best-practices.md
EDA Playbook	Exploratory Data Analysis workflows	eda-playbook.md
Change Management SOP	Ticketing, change tracking, and escalation process	change-management.md

3. Getting Started
A. First Steps

Review the Documentation Home to get an overview of all resources.
Clone or fork the relevant repositories from Git.
Set up your development environment (e.g., SQL clients, IDEs).
Schedule a 1:1 onboarding session with your mentor or team lead.

4. Core Workflows
A. Data Validation
Use the Validation & QC Guide for standard gates and sample queries.
Report any anomalies using Jira and the issue escalation template.
B. Mapping & Transformation
Always reference the Mapping Reference before starting any new mapping.
Document any new or changed transformations as part of your work.
C. Joins & Deduplication
Follow Joins Best Practices to avoid row explosion or data loss.
Always checkpoint row counts before and after major joins.
D. Change Management
Log all changes in the Change Management SOP before moving to production.
All changes require peer review and sign-off.

Escalation: Contact your lead or the data governance team for urgent issues

6. Compliance & Best Practices
Never handle or export PHI unless explicitly authorized.
Use only non-PHI, vendor-agnostic examples in documentation and queries.
Follow coding, naming, and documentation standards as outlined in the README.

7. Feedback & Continuous Improvement
Please suggest edits or open issues if you find gaps in this guide or any documentation. We continuously improve our documentation and processes based on team feedback.
