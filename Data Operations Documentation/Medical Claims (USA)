🏥 Medical Claims Lifecycle Primer & Reference
A comprehensive overview of the U.S. medical claims process, its data artifacts, and key business and data touchpoints. Designed for onboarding, business context, compliance, and reference.

1. Introduction
The U.S. healthcare claims system is a multi-stage process involving providers, payers, patients, and regulatory entities. Understanding the medical claim lifecycle is essential for accurate data mapping, analytics, compliance, and process improvement.

2. Key Stakeholders
Stakeholder	Role/Description
Patient	Receives healthcare services and initiates claims flow
Provider	Delivers care; submits claims for reimbursement
Payer/Insurer	Adjudicates, approves/denies, and pays claims
Clearinghouse	Facilitates secure claim data transfer
Government	Regulates (CMS, NIH, FDA); covers public programs
3. Stages of the Medical Claim Lifecycle
3.1. 📋 Patient Visit
Description: Patient receives healthcare services from a provider.
Artifact: Encounter data, medical records.
3.2. 📝 Documentation
Description: Provider documents diagnoses, procedures, and services.
Artifact: Encounter notes, coding (ICD, CPT/HCPCS).
3.3. 💻 Claim Submission
Description: Provider/billing system generates an electronic claim (EDI 837 format).
Artifact: Raw claims file with patient, provider, service, and charge details.
3.4. 🔍 Claim Processing
Description: Payer/clearinghouse validates claim for format, completeness, and eligibility.
Artifact: Claim status file (EDI 277), validation logs.
3.5. 📧 Claim Adjudication
Description: Payer applies coverage rules, negotiates rates, identifies duplicates, and decides approval/denial.
Artifact: Adjudication output (allowed/denied codes, payment reason codes).
3.6. 💸 Payment
Description: Payer reimburses provider for approved claims.
Artifact: Remittance advice (EDI 835), payment record.
3.7. 📊 Patient Billing
Description: Provider bills patient for non-covered amounts (co-pay, deductible, coinsurance).
Artifact: Patient statement, balance bill.
3.8. 🏦 Reconciliation & Audit
Description: Provider reconciles received payments vs. submitted claims; audits for gaps, denials, or errors.
Artifact: Payment reconciliation report, audit trails.
4. Data Artifacts by Stage
Stage	Data Table/Source	Key Fields
Documentation	EMR / encounter tables	patient_id, provider_id, service_date, diagnosis_code, procedure_code
Claim Submission	Raw claims (header/detail)	claim_id, patient_id, provider_id, charge_amount, service dates
Processing	Claims status log	claim_id, validation_status, error_code
Adjudication	Adjudication files/tables	claim_id, allowed_amount, denial_reason
Payment	Payment/remittance tables	claim_id, payment_amount, payment_date
Patient Billing	Billing tables	claim_id, patient_id, balance_due
Reconciliation	Reconciliation reports	claim_id, paid_amount, expected_amount
5. Common Data Elements
Patient Info: Name, DOB, gender, insurance ID
Provider Info: NPI, name, taxonomy, location
Service Info: Dates, place of service, rendering/billing provider
Diagnosis Codes: ICD-10 (up to 25 per claim)
Procedure Codes: CPT/HCPCS (up to 25 per claim)
Claim Financials: Total charge, allowed, paid, copay, deductible, coinsurance, discount
Status/Reason Codes: Adjudication and payment outcomes
Identifiers: Claim number, line number, batch ID
6. Claims Data Structures
Header: Claim-level (overall) fields (e.g., claim_id, patient_id, total_charge)
Detail/Line: Line-level fields (e.g., procedure_code, charge_amount, units)
Multi-valued Fields: Repeated fields (diagnoses, procedures, modifiers)
Linkage: claim_id ties header and detail tables
7. Claims Processing Challenges
Data Quality: Inconsistent coding, missing/incorrect fields
Timeliness: Delays in submission or adjudication
Compliance: Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, CMS)
Fraud & Abuse: Detection of duplicate, upcoded, or phantom claims
Denials: Managing and appealing denied claims
8. Mapping & Transformation Reference
Raw → GDF → CDF:
Raw: Direct from source files (often as submitted by provider)
GDF: Normalized, deduplicated, and typecast; field mapping, scaling, date formatting
CDF: Client-specific schema; mapped from GDF, may include custom business logic
Common Transformations:
Date standardization (yyyyMMdd)
Amounts in cents (no decimals)
Boolean conversion (Y/N → TRUE/FALSE)
Multi-valued fields mapped to arrays or indexed columns
9. Example Claim Flow (with Data Artifacts)
Patient Visit:
EMR Table: encounter_id, patient_id, provider_id
Claim Submission:
Raw Claims Header: claim_id, total_charge
Raw Claims Detail: claim_id, line_number, procedure_code
Processing/Adjudication:
Adjudication Table: claim_id, allowed_amount, denial_reason
Payment:
Remittance Table: claim_id, paid_amount
Billing/Reconciliation:
Patient Statement: claim_id, balance_due
Reconciliation Report: claim_id, expected_vs_paid
