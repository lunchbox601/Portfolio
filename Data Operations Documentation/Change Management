🔄 Change Management & Issue Log SOP
A reference guide for tracking, reviewing, and approving all mapping, transformation, and data quality changes in the healthcare claims pipeline. Designed for auditability, accountability, and continuous improvement.

1. Purpose
Ensure all changes and known issues are logged, tracked, and resolved in a transparent, compliant manner.
Facilitate peer review, sign-off, and audit readiness for all critical data pipeline changes.
2. When to Log a Change or Issue
Field mapping or transformation logic is added, updated, or deprecated
Data quality gap (e.g., missing data, unexpected nulls, failed validation gate)
Business rules or requirements change
Production issue or bug is discovered
Field or table is added/removed/renamed
3. Change Log Template
Date	Field/Table	Old Logic / Mapping	New Logic / Mapping	Reason / Root Cause	Owner	Status	Approved By	Comments
2024-05-01	claim_paid_amount	raw value	raw * 100, cast to STRING	Standardize cents storage	J. Doe	Complete	QA Lead	See validation query
2024-05-12	capitation_indicator	N/A	Y→TRUE, N→FALSE	New reporting requirement	S. Lee	Pending		
...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...
4. Issue Log Template
Date	Field/Table	Issue Description	Severity	Status	Owner	Resolution / Next Steps	Resolution Date

5. Change & Issue Management Workflow
A. End-to-End Flow
Log the Change/Issue
Use the templates above; record in the shared log (spreadsheet, Confluence, or database).
Initial Review & Assignment
Assign a responsible analyst/owner.
Triage for impact and urgency.
Analysis & Documentation (Analyst’s Work)
Investigate the issue/root cause using queries or code review.
Document your findings clearly in the log, including:
Queries or scripts used.
Evidence of the issue (query output, screenshots, summary metrics).
Hypothesis and reasoning.
If applicable, attach a “before/after” validation result.
If a fix or change is required, propose the solution (including updated SQL/mapping/logic).
Record any blockers, open questions, or assumptions.
Peer Review & Approval
Submit your documentation and proposed fix for peer or QA lead review.
Address peer feedback and re-document as needed.
Implement & Test
Apply the fix in code, mapping, or ETL.
Attach or cite validation/QC queries to confirm resolution.
Resolution & Sign-Off
Mark as Complete/Closed in the log.
Update documentation and notify stakeholders if required.
Archive supporting evidence for audit trail.
Audit Trail
Retain all logs, documentation, queries, and outputs for compliance/audit.
B. Analyst Documentation Instructions
When assigned an issue or change, you must:

Summarize the Issue

Restate the problem or change in your own words.
Reference the log entry (date, field/table, description).
Investigate & Gather Evidence

Write and run relevant SQL or code to reproduce/understand the issue.
Save query text and output (paste results, or attach screenshots if allowed).
Quantify the impact (row counts affected, % blank, # of violations, etc.).
Propose Solution (if applicable)

Write the updated SQL, mapping, or business rule.
Provide a summary of how the fix addresses the issue.
Include proposed validation/QC queries.
Document Work in the Log

Paste or link your analysis, queries, and findings in the Comments or Resolution/Next Steps column.
Clearly state the result: fixed, not reproducible, needs escalation, etc.
Mark for Review

Indicate in the log when your work is “Ready for QA Review.”
Assign or notify the designated reviewer.
Archive Supporting Materials

Store all scripts, outputs, and screenshots in a shared location (e.g., repo, Confluence, or ticket attachments).
6. Communication & Escalation
Escalate Critical/High issues to data governance and project leadership immediately.
Use Jira (or equivalent) for issues that require cross-team coordination.
Provide weekly updates on open and recently resolved changes/issues.
7. Best Practices
Always link changes/issues to validation or QC queries whenever possible.
Reference related documentation (mapping tables, field dictionaries, SOPs).
Use consistent field/table naming and clear, specific descriptions.
Review and archive closed items quarterly to maintain log hygiene.
Analysts: Document every meaningful step, even if the resolution is “no action needed.”
