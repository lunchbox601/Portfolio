📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Playbook
A practical reference for profiling, understanding, and documenting the contents and quality of healthcare data sets. Designed for onboarding, data quality improvement, and audit readiness.

1. Why EDA Matters
Uncovers the true structure, content, and quirks of each dataset.
Identifies data quality issues and mapping opportunities early.
Informs transformation, validation, and mapping logic.
Supports defensible decision-making and compliance.

2. EDA Workflow Checklist
Step	Purpose	Example Output
Schema & Metadata Review	Understand columns, types, and expectations	Column dictionary, field notes
Population Checks	Measure non-null/blank, null, and blank rates	Table of population %, null %, blank %
Value Distribution	Find distinct values, common codes, outliers	Frequency tables, histograms
Range & Format Profiling	Check min/max, regex, and outlier boundaries	Numeric stats, format pass rates
Uniqueness & Duplication	Detect duplicate or multi-valued keys	PK uniqueness %, duplicate count
Cross-Field Consistency	Validate key business rules and relationships	Cross-tab tables, rule violation list
Missing Data Analysis	Quantify and document missingness	Missingness table by field
Anomaly & Outlier Detection	Spot unexpected patterns	Outlier lists, summary notes

3. Example EDA SQL Patterns
A. Schema Review
sql
DESCRIBE ;

Copy
B. Population/Null/Blank Check
sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  SUM(CASE WHEN field IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS nulls,
  SUM(CASE WHEN TRIM(CAST(field AS STRING)) = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS blanks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN field IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(CAST(field AS STRING)) <> '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS populated,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN field IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(CAST(field AS STRING)) <> '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS pct_populated
FROM <table></table>;

Copy
C. Value Frequency
sql
SELECT field, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM <table></table>
GROUP BY field
ORDER BY freq DESC
LIMIT 20;

Copy
D. Numeric Range & Outlier
sql
SELECT
  MIN(field) AS min_val,
  MAX(field) AS max_val,
  AVG(field) AS avg_val,
  PERCENTILE(field, 0.01) AS p1,
  PERCENTILE(field, 0.99) AS p99
FROM <table></table>
WHERE field IS NOT NULL;

Copy
E. Format/Regex Check
sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN field RLIKE '^[0-9]{8}$' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS yyyymmdd_ok,
  SUM(CASE WHEN field LIKE '%-%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_dash
FROM <table></table>;

Copy
F. Duplicate Key Check
sql
SELECT pk_col, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM <table></table>
GROUP BY pk_col
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 20;

Copy
4. EDA Reporting Template
Field Name	Data Type	Populated %	Null %	Distinct Values	Common Values	Min	Max	Format Pass %	Notes
patient_id	STRING	100	0	1,000,000	...	...	...	100	PK, 9-digit
claim_date	STRING	99.8	0.2	365	...	...	...	99.7	yyyyMMdd
...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...
5. Documenting EDA Findings
Record all key findings, anomalies, and recommendations in your EDA summary.
Flag fields needing special mapping, transformation, or validation.
Store EDA summaries in project repo or Confluence for future reference.
6. Integrating EDA into Data Onboarding
Complete EDA before mapping or validation work begins.
Use EDA findings to inform mapping tables, validation gates, and change logs.
Reference EDA documentation in onboarding and audit materials.
